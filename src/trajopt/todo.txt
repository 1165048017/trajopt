Make collision checker able to remove objects

Write function to check trajectory safety

More validation on initialization

Don't allow non-robot kinbodies to collide

Partition links into groups and do broadphase filtering

make optimization parameters settable

bug when using "active" as manip

openrave initfromtrimesh bug

velocity cost uses timestamps
velocity cost uses weights

cloud_drive_reach.py--error
can't start at non-origin position? (cloud drive reach)

two things don't work about drc example:
1. go thru obstacle
2. sometimes don't satisfy pose constraint

ENABLED DOESNT WORK

problem in convexdecomp: we don't check to see if new point is ok in some direction

Issue: now the collision checker will fail to find grazing self-collisions, since right now the continuous check
doesn't look at robot-robot collisions.

modifying bttransformaabb is a bad hack

unittest for removal

make it easier to print stuff out for debuggin

setcontactdistance screws you up if you have multiple collision cost groups

optimization changes state
