Critical
=========

ENABLED DOESNT WORK
problem in convexdecomp: we don't check to see if new point is ok in some direction
bug when using "active" as manip (?)

cloud_drive_reach.py--error
can't start at non-origin position? (cloud drive reach)

setcontactdistance screws you up if you have multiple collision cost groups

optimization changes state




Eventually
===========

Figure out some consistent scheme for specifiying timestep of costs.

Run automated tests with python examples

velocity cost uses timestamps
make optimization parameters settable

two things don't work about drc example:
1. go thru obstacle
2. sometimes don't satisfy pose constraint

Issue: now the collision checker will fail to find grazing self-collisions, since right now the continuous check
doesn't look at robot-robot collisions.

make a function specifically for self-collision testing

error message for unrecognized arguments

Maybe
=======

Partition links into groups and do broadphase filtering (?)
Modifying bttransformaabb is a bad hack. figure out a better way.
make it easier to print stuff out for debugging optimization

collisionchecker segfaults if bullet world isn't updated
